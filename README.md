# Hello and welcome!

To start the app, simply open a terminal within the repository and write “npm install” (without the “ “). When it is done installing, write “npm start” (without the “ “) in the same terminal. After a short while you will be presented with our login page in your browser.

Click on “create new user” and select a username - we suggest something fun like “HiddenHippo” to follow the style of other users of the platform, but feel free to let your creativity flow.

Once you have created a user, you will be directed to the login page, where you type in your email and password. And there you go! You are now able to post a secret story on our StealthStories website :-D

Have fun!
